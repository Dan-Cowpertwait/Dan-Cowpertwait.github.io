After a few months of toiling away, reading course material, watching YouTube and following tutorial after tutorial online, I came to a drastic conclusion.... I could never be a developer.

It was bizarre, intimidating and frustrating. I assumed due to my natural affinity for scripting languages and surface level computing, I'd find coding to be a walk in the park... Oh how wrong I was. Despite memorizing pages of syntax, I found it impossible to wrap my head around the simplest concepts behind development in ruby.

At this time, I was working through the early stages of my Flatiron school Web Development Program. I found myself repeating lab after lab without grasping any true understanding around the concepts of how my code was to be used in real world applications. 

This was when at a certain time in the course, I began learning about object orientation.

After watching a video by Flatiron school co-founder Avi Flombaum, In his explanation and insistence of repetition and revision. Something clicked. I began playing around more naturally with code and the way that object orientation functions as a whole, rather than just in the set examples i'd been repeating. 

Before long, I'd gone through dozens of videos and walkthroughs from the program, writing my own code endlessly, totaling around 20 hours in repetition of the principles behind OO in ruby and command line interfaces.

Before long, I'd smashed through the first third of my course and was at my first independent project. 

With a blank Ubuntu terminal and Atom in front of me. I began to code my first CLI, focused around my newest obsession, The Witcher, and the Lore that surrounds it's world (maximum nerd I know).

Despite the program listing 45-60 hours to complete the project. I had mine done in 9.

It was bizzare, exciting and absurdly satisfying. All of a sudden, I felt becoming a developer was in my reach. 

Hell yeah Flatiron.
