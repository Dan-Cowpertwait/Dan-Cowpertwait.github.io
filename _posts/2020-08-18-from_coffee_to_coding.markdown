My progress into my completion of my course with FlatIron has been a strange journey to say the least.

3 years ago, I was making coffee at a festival in the UK when I had a friend mention he had some pretty well paid freelance work with a small coffee roasters doing pop-ups for some business I'd never heard of.

Turns out, the hiring manager of the job was at the very festival I was making coffee at, and sure enough after a quick introduction over a beer and live music, I had a job interview lined up at their flagship location in Aldwych House, London.

Excited at the prospect of a new freelance gig with decent pay, I arrived at the location of my interview expecting a small cafe or a classic business with a pop-up stall.

Boy was I in for a suprise.

Turns out, the location of this gig was a multinational co-working space called WeWork. The building was beautiful, freelancers worked across the community space in brightly decored open plan offices, with cheery staff giving them everything they needed. Beside them, was the most beautiful coffee station I'd ever seen.

Luckily I got the job, and six months later was up for Team Leader as the company grew by leaps and bounds.

I loved my job, but unfortunatley, my life wasn't quite what I wanted. Life in London had worn me down over the years and I found myself increasingly fed up with the toil and trial that the big smoke of the city was challenging me with.

At this time, I was a lead barista for the head office of WeWorks European division and after some discussion with the team, I realised my prospects of working at WeWork were high as I'd impressed many of the community managers in my rounds across the city.

Without hesitation, I applied for a job in Melbourne Australia, a city I knew would be the medium between the big city and the small town life I was accustomed to.

Long story short, 6 months later, I was sitting behind a community desk on the other side of the world, giving the helping hand I'd admired so much on that fateful day I'd arrived at Aldwych House.

Though something still wasn't right. I loved my job as always, but customer service never satisfied my constant curiosity and want for challenge. My manager always said I was in a race with myself, and he was right!

I searched for new options within the company. Facilities?... no. How about Events?... Not really my jam.

Then something came up I did not expect. In my creation of the weekly newsletter I had a section to add about the FlatIron school, a coding bootcamp I'd known from my time in London. With my love for technology and need for a constant challenge, I enquired about the company with my manager. He came back to me with some of the greatest news of my life.

Flatiron was helping WeWork community teams with scholarships onto their software engineering course.

Jumping on the chance, I completed my 100 hour bootcamp entry requirement and eagerly awaited my chance at joining the full course. 

Sure enough it came through and I commited. 6 months later, here I am, writing this blog post at my point of graduation.

I don't know what the future holds, but if track record says anything, I'd say it looks bright as ever.
