**Atom**

A GitHub created editor with a bunch of functionality


Pros

- Highly customizable with almost 2,000 theme variations
-  Supports plugins to extend its functionality, with thousands of options available
-  Includes a flexible autocompletion system

Cons

- Not great with WSL, impossible to allow through Windows as a file manager.


**VS code**

A beautiful, pretty fresh editor put out by our old pal microsoft. Arguably the best thing they've released in years

Pros

- Very light in weight and takes very little time to start.
- Syntax highlights are available for almost every programming language.
- Lots of themes and plugins

Cons

- No git merging, which many people have come to expect as Atom has the ability to do that
- Notorious on battery usage for some reason

**Notepad ++**

Simple as it gets and been around for longer than most.

Pros 

- Autosaving!
- Nice color coding for languages 
- Uses bugger all storage and memory

Cons

- Struggles with a huge amount of data
- No dark mode/themes (it's 2020 come on!)


I've used all three of these, and bear in mind this is only my opinion, though I hope it helps!
