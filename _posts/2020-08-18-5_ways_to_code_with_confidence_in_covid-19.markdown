Coding in these difficult times can be a stressful experience. The world is a turmolous place and having been in Melbourne for the best part of the year, I can say being locked inside can get pretty dry after a few months or so, so I thought I'd share a few ways I've made my experience a little easier.

1) Routine Routine Routine!

Having a solid routine can make the average day so much more managable. Letting yourself flit about without purpose is the number one way to sidetrack your thoughts to places that may not be so productive. Any level of this helps. I myself break my day up into 2 hour slots, to allow myself time to focus on each individual task that I'd like to accomplish, lifes so much easier in bite sized pieces.

2) Think creativley

Allowing yourself an hour or two away from the endless code, to think off screen can make the world of difference. Take a break and write on paper for a change, watch a tutorial, think about a project you'd enjoy.

3) Don't let the news get you down

Every day these days feels like another damage report. But remember, if you're coding, you're doing okay! A computer in front of you, a roof over your head and food in your cupboard means that statisically you're in the top 15% of the worlds population in terms of quality of life. Let the bad news not be a reminder of a worse off world, but of better off life. Appreciate what you got!

4) Reward yourself

Passed that test? Finished that lab? Managed to finally get bootstrap installed on rails 6? Give yourself a pat on the back and something extra. I always have my favourite bevvy or snack on hand as a reward for doing something I really found tough.

5) You're not alone!

We're all in this together, through the joys of the web, reaching out to coding communities and fellow students has never been easier, you'd be suprised of the joys you'll get from a light hearted chat
